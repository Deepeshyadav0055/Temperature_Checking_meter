🚀 Project Overview

This project is a dynamic weather-style temperature converter built using core web technologies.
I designed and developed it to practice JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and advanced CSS animations, while creating a UI that feels like a real weather application.


🛠️ Technologies Used 

HTML5 – Structure and layout
CSS3 – Styling, animations, gradients, glassmorphism UI
JavaScript (ES6) – Temperature conversion logic and dynamic UI updates

✨ Features

Converts temperature between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
Dynamic sky background that changes based on temperature
Animated clouds and rain effect for realistic weather feel
Glassmorphism-style weather card
